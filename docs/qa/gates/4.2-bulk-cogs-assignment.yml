nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper authentication, cabinetId validation, input validation, max items limit (1000) prevents resource exhaustion, temporal versioning for audit trail"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "TanStack Query caching, multi-page selection persistence, efficient bulk API (max 1000 items), preview dialog prevents accidental operations, retry only failed items"
