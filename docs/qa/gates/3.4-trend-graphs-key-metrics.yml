  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API calls use centralized API client with proper authentication headers (JWT, X-Cabinet-Id). Parallel requests handled safely with error isolation."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient parallel fetching for multiple weeks, 1min stale time, 5min cache time, refetch on window focus. Graceful degradation - failed weeks don't block entire chart."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling with retry option, handles empty data gracefully, filters out failed week fetches without failing entire request, chronological sorting ensures proper time series display"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "TrendGraph component 189 lines (under 200), useTrends hook 111 lines, comprehensive test coverage (10 tests), follows design patterns from ExpenseChart and MetricCard"
