  Excellent implementation with production-ready quality:

  - Proper accessibility: role=combobox, aria-expanded, aria-label, aria-haspopup
  - Search functionality for lists >10 options
  - Visual feedback with border highlight on selection
  - Clear button with proper event handling (stopPropagation)
  - URL state persistence for shareable links
  - Filters reset on week range change (per PO decision)
