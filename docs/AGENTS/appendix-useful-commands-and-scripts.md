# Appendix - Useful Commands and Scripts

## Frequently Used Commands

```bash
npm run dev         # Start development server
npm run build       # Production build
npm run migrate     # Run database migrations
npm run seed        # Seed test data
```

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

- **Logs**: Check `logs/app.log` for application logs
- **Debug Mode**: Set `DEBUG=app:*` for verbose logging
- **Common Issues**: See `docs/troubleshooting.md`]]

## 4. Document Delivery

1. **In Web UI (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude)**:
   - Present the entire document in one response (or multiple if too long)
   - Tell user to copy and save as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` or `docs/project-architecture.md`
   - Mention it can be sharded later in IDE if needed

2. **In IDE Environment**:
   - Create the document as `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`
   - Inform user this single document contains all architectural information
   - Can be sharded later using PO agent if desired

The document should be comprehensive enough that future agents can understand:

- The actual state of the system (not idealized)
- Where to find key files and logic
- What technical debt exists
- What constraints must be respected
- If PRD provided: What needs to change for the enhancement]]

## 5. Quality Assurance

CRITICAL: Before finalizing the document:

1. **Accuracy Check**: Verify all technical details match the actual codebase
2. **Completeness Review**: Ensure all major system components are documented
3. **Focus Validation**: If user provided scope, verify relevant areas are emphasized
4. **Clarity Assessment**: Check that explanations are clear for AI agents
5. **Navigation**: Ensure document has clear section structure for easy reference

Apply the advanced elicitation task after major sections to refine based on user feedback.
