   - Adjust scope or focus
   - Add missing elements
   - Clarify ambiguities

## 6. Next Steps Guidance

**Execution Options:**

1. **Use with AI Research Assistant**: Provide this prompt to an AI model with research capabilities
2. **Guide Human Research**: Use as a framework for manual research efforts
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine AI and human research using this structure

**Integration Points:**

- How findings will feed into next phases
- Which team members should review results
- How to validate findings
- When to revisit or expand research
