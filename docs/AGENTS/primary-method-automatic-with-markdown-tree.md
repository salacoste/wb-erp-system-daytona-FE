# Primary Method: Automatic with markdown-tree

[[LLM: First, check if markdownExploder is set to true in .bmad-core/core-config.yaml. If it is, attempt to run the command: `md-tree explode {input file} {output path}`.

If the command succeeds, inform the user that the document has been sharded successfully and STOP - do not proceed further.

If the command fails (especially with an error indicating the command is not found or not available), inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is enabled but the md-tree command is not available. Please either:

1. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`
2. Or set markdownExploder to false in .bmad-core/core-config.yaml

**IMPORTANT: STOP HERE - do not proceed with manual sharding until one of the above actions is taken.**"

If markdownExploder is set to false, inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is currently false. For better performance and reliability, you should:

1. Set markdownExploder to true in .bmad-core/core-config.yaml
2. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`

I will now proceed with the manual sharding process."

Then proceed with the manual method below ONLY if markdownExploder is false.]]

## Installation and Usage

1. **Install globally**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser
   ```

2. **Use the explode command**:

   ```bash
   # For PRD
   md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd

   # For Architecture
   md-tree explode docs/architecture.md docs/architecture

   # For any document
   md-tree explode [source-document] [destination-folder]
   ```

3. **What it does**:
   - Automatically splits the document by level 2 sections
   - Creates properly named files
   - Adjusts heading levels appropriately
   - Handles all edge cases with code blocks and special markdown

If the user has @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser installed, use it and skip the manual process below.
