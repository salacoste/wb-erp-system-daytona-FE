# Risk Scoring Algorithm

Calculate overall story risk score:

```text
Base Score = 100
For each risk:
  - Critical (9): Deduct 20 points
  - High (6): Deduct 10 points
  - Medium (4): Deduct 5 points
  - Low (2-3): Deduct 2 points

Minimum score = 0 (extremely risky)
Maximum score = 100 (minimal risk)
```
