# Another Folder

Documents within the `another-folder/` directory:

## [Nested Document](./another-folder/document.md)

Description of nested document.
```

## Index Entry Format

Each entry should follow this format:

```markdown
## [Document Title](relative/path/to/file.md)

Brief description of the document's purpose and contents.
```

## Rules of Operation

1. NEVER modify the content of indexed files
2. Preserve existing descriptions in index.md when they are adequate
3. Maintain any existing categorization or grouping in the index
4. Use relative paths for all links (starting with `./`)
5. Ensure descriptions are concise but informative
6. NEVER remove entries without explicit confirmation
7. Report any broken links or inconsistencies found
8. Allow path updates for moved files before considering removal
9. Create folder sections using level 2 headings (`##`)
10. Sort folders alphabetically, with root documents listed first
11. Within each section, sort documents alphabetically by title

## Process Output

The task will provide:

1. A summary of changes made to index.md
2. List of newly indexed files (organized by folder)
3. List of updated entries
4. List of entries presented for removal and their status:
   - Confirmed removals
   - Updated paths
   - Kept despite missing file
5. Any new folders discovered
6. Any other issues or inconsistencies found

## Handling Missing Files

For each file referenced in the index but not found in the filesystem:

1. Present the entry:

   ```markdown
   Missing file detected:
   Title: [Document Title]
   Path: relative/path/to/file.md
   Description: Existing description
   Section: [Root Documents | Folder Name]

   Options:

   1. Remove this entry
   2. Update the file path
   3. Keep entry (mark as temporarily unavailable)

   Please choose an option (1/2/3):
   ```

2. Wait for user confirmation before taking any action
3. Log the decision for the final report

## Special Cases

1. **Sharded Documents**: If a folder contains an `index.md` file, treat it as a sharded document:
   - Use the folder's `index.md` title as the section title
   - List the folder's documents as subsections
   - Note in the description that this is a multi-part document

2. **README files**: Convert `README.md` to more descriptive titles based on content

3. **Nested Subfolders**: For deeply nested folders, maintain the hierarchy but limit to 2 levels in the main index. Deeper structures should have their own index files.
