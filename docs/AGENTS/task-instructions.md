# Task Instructions

## 1. Intelligent Method Selection

**Context Analysis**: Before presenting options, analyze:

- **Content Type**: Technical specs, user stories, architecture, requirements, etc.
- **Complexity Level**: Simple, moderate, or complex content
- **Stakeholder Needs**: Who will use this information
- **Risk Level**: High-impact decisions vs routine items
- **Creative Potential**: Opportunities for innovation or alternatives

**Method Selection Strategy**:

1. **Always Include Core Methods** (choose 3-4):
   - Expand or Contract for Audience
   - Critique and Refine
   - Identify Potential Risks
   - Assess Alignment with Goals

2. **Context-Specific Methods** (choose 4-5):
   - **Technical Content**: Tree of Thoughts, ReWOO, Meta-Prompting
   - **User-Facing Content**: Agile Team Perspective, Stakeholder Roundtable
   - **Creative Content**: Innovation Tournament, Escape Room Challenge
   - **Strategic Content**: Red Team vs Blue Team, Hindsight Reflection

3. **Always Include**: "Proceed / No Further Actions" as option 9

## 2. Section Context and Review

When invoked after outputting a section:

1. **Provide Context Summary**: Give a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented

2. **Explain Visual Elements**: If the section contains diagrams, explain them briefly before offering elicitation options

3. **Clarify Scope Options**: If the section contains multiple distinct items, inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:
   - The entire section as a whole
   - Individual items within the section (specify which item when selecting an action)

## 3. Present Elicitation Options

**Review Request Process:**

- Ask the user to review the drafted section
- In the SAME message, inform them they can suggest direct changes OR select an elicitation method
- Present 9 intelligently selected methods (0-8) plus "Proceed" (9)
- Keep descriptions short - just the method name
- Await simple numeric selection

**Action List Presentation Format:**

```text
**Advanced Elicitation Options**
Choose a number (0-8) or 9 to proceed:

0. [Method Name]
1. [Method Name]
2. [Method Name]
3. [Method Name]
4. [Method Name]
5. [Method Name]
6. [Method Name]
7. [Method Name]
8. [Method Name]
9. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

**Response Handling:**

- **Numbers 0-8**: Execute the selected method, then re-offer the choice
- **Number 9**: Proceed to next section or continue conversation
- **Direct Feedback**: Apply user's suggested changes and continue

## 4. Method Execution Framework

**Execution Process:**

1. **Retrieve Method**: Access the specific elicitation method from the elicitation-methods data file
2. **Apply Context**: Execute the method from your current role's perspective
3. **Provide Results**: Deliver insights, critiques, or alternatives relevant to the content
4. **Re-offer Choice**: Present the same 9 options again until user selects 9 or gives direct feedback

**Execution Guidelines:**

- **Be Concise**: Focus on actionable insights, not lengthy explanations
- **Stay Relevant**: Tie all elicitation back to the specific content being analyzed
- **Identify Personas**: For multi-persona methods, clearly identify which viewpoint is speaking
- **Maintain Flow**: Keep the process moving efficiently
```
