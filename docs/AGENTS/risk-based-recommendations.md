# Risk-Based Recommendations

Based on risk profile, recommend:

1. **Testing Priority**
   - Which tests to run first
   - Additional test types needed
   - Test environment requirements

2. **Development Focus**
   - Code review emphasis areas
   - Additional validation needed
   - Security controls to implement

3. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Phased rollout for high-risk changes
   - Feature flags for risky features
   - Rollback procedures

4. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Metrics to track
   - Alerts to configure
   - Dashboard requirements
