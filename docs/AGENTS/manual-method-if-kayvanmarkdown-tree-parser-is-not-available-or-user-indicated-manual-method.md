# Manual Method (if @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser is not available or user indicated manual method)

## Task Instructions

1. Identify Document and Target Location

- Determine which document to shard (user-provided path)
- Create a new folder under `docs/` with the same name as the document (without extension)
- Example: `docs/prd.md` → create folder `docs/prd/`

2. Parse and Extract Sections

CRITICAL AEGNT SHARDING RULES:

1. Read the entire document content
2. Identify all level 2 sections (## headings)
3. For each level 2 section:
   - Extract the section heading and ALL content until the next level 2 section
   - Include all subsections, code blocks, diagrams, lists, tables, etc.
   - Be extremely careful with:
     - Fenced code blocks (```) - ensure you capture the full block including closing backticks and account for potential misleading level 2's that are actually part of a fenced section example
     - Mermaid diagrams - preserve the complete diagram syntax
     - Nested markdown elements
     - Multi-line content that might contain ## inside code blocks

CRITICAL: Use proper parsing that understands markdown context. A ## inside a code block is NOT a section header.]]

## 3. Create Individual Files

For each extracted section:

1. **Generate filename**: Convert the section heading to lowercase-dash-case
   - Remove special characters
   - Replace spaces with dashes
   - Example: "## Tech Stack" → `tech-stack.md`

2. **Adjust heading levels**:
   - The level 2 heading becomes level 1 (# instead of ##) in the sharded new document
   - All subsection levels decrease by 1:

   ```txt
     - ### → ##
     - #### → ###
     - ##### → ####
     - etc.
   ```

3. **Write content**: Save the adjusted content to the new file

## 4. Create Index File

Create an `index.md` file in the sharded folder that:

1. Contains the original level 1 heading and any content before the first level 2 section
2. Lists all the sharded files with links:
