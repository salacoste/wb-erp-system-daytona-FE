# Instructions

## 1. Project Analysis (Required)

Before creating the epic, gather essential information about the existing project:

**Existing Project Context:**

- [ ] Project purpose and current functionality understood
- [ ] Existing technology stack identified
- [ ] Current architecture patterns noted
- [ ] Integration points with existing system identified

**Enhancement Scope:**

- [ ] Enhancement clearly defined and scoped
- [ ] Impact on existing functionality assessed
- [ ] Required integration points identified
- [ ] Success criteria established

## 2. Epic Creation

Create a focused epic following this structure:

### Epic Title

{{Enhancement Name}} - Brownfield Enhancement

### Epic Goal

{{1-2 sentences describing what the epic will accomplish and why it adds value}}

### Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: {{brief description}}
- Technology stack: {{relevant existing technologies}}
- Integration points: {{where new work connects to existing system}}

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: {{clear description}}
- How it integrates: {{integration approach}}
- Success criteria: {{measurable outcomes}}

### Stories

List 1-3 focused stories that complete the epic:

1. **Story 1:** {{Story title and brief description}}
2. **Story 2:** {{Story title and brief description}}
3. **Story 3:** {{Story title and brief description}}

### Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal

### Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** {{main risk to existing system}}
- **Mitigation:** {{how risk will be addressed}}
- **Rollback Plan:** {{how to undo changes if needed}}

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features

## 3. Validation Checklist

Before finalizing the epic, ensure:

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Epic can be completed in 1-3 stories maximum
- [ ] No architectural documentation is required
- [ ] Enhancement follows existing patterns
- [ ] Integration complexity is manageable

**Risk Assessment:**

- [ ] Risk to existing system is low
- [ ] Rollback plan is feasible
- [ ] Testing approach covers existing functionality
- [ ] Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points

**Completeness Check:**

- [ ] Epic goal is clear and achievable
- [ ] Stories are properly scoped
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Dependencies are identified

## 4. Handoff to Story Manager

Once the epic is validated, provide this handoff to the Story Manager:

---

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running {{technology stack}}
- Integration points: {{list key integration points}}
- Existing patterns to follow: {{relevant existing patterns}}
- Critical compatibility requirements: {{key requirements}}
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering {{epic goal}}."
