# Traceability Process

## 1. Extract Requirements

Identify all testable requirements from:

- Acceptance Criteria (primary source)
- User story statement
- Tasks/subtasks with specific behaviors
- Non-functional requirements mentioned
- Edge cases documented

## 2. Map to Test Cases

For each requirement, document which tests validate it. Use Given-When-Then to describe what the test validates (not how it's written):

```yaml
requirement: 'AC1: User can login with valid credentials'
test_mappings:
  - test_file: 'auth/login.test.ts'
    test_case: 'should successfully login with valid email and password'
    # Given-When-Then describes WHAT the test validates, not HOW it's coded
    given: 'A registered user with valid credentials'
    when: 'They submit the login form'
    then: 'They are redirected to dashboard and session is created'
    coverage: full

  - test_file: 'e2e/auth-flow.test.ts'
    test_case: 'complete login flow'
    given: 'User on login page'
    when: 'Entering valid credentials and submitting'
    then: 'Dashboard loads with user data'
    coverage: integration
```

## 3. Coverage Analysis

Evaluate coverage for each requirement:

**Coverage Levels:**

- `full`: Requirement completely tested
- `partial`: Some aspects tested, gaps exist
- `none`: No test coverage found
- `integration`: Covered in integration/e2e tests only
- `unit`: Covered in unit tests only

## 4. Gap Identification

Document any gaps found:

```yaml
coverage_gaps:
  - requirement: 'AC3: Password reset email sent within 60 seconds'
    gap: 'No test for email delivery timing'
    severity: medium
    suggested_test:
      type: integration
      description: 'Test email service SLA compliance'

  - requirement: 'AC5: Support 1000 concurrent users'
    gap: 'No load testing implemented'
    severity: high
    suggested_test:
      type: performance
      description: 'Load test with 1000 concurrent connections'
```
