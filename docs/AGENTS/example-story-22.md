# Example: Story 2.2

Given gate `docs/project/qa/gates/2.2-*.yml` shows

- `coverage_gaps`: Back action behavior untested (AC2)
- `coverage_gaps`: Centralized dependencies enforcement untested (AC4)

Fix plan:

- Add a test ensuring the Toolkit Menu "Back" action returns to Main Menu
- Add a static test verifying imports for service/view go through `deps.ts`
- Re-run lint/tests and update Dev Agent Record + File List accordingly
